This is a Haskell program to solve binary puzzles, or binary sudoku like those you can find at [http://www.binarypuzzle.com/index.php](binarypuzzle.com).

[Prior art](https://github.com/shlomif/binary-puzzle-garden) exists for solving binary puzzles using code, but not in Haskell that I am aware of.

My approach owes a lot to Richard Bird's sudoku solver in Pearls of Functional Algortithim design.
