This is a Haskell program to solve binary puzzles, or binary sudoku like those you can find at [binarypuzzle.com](http://www.binarypuzzle.com/index.php).

[Prior art](https://github.com/shlomif/binary-puzzle-garden) exists for solving binary puzzles using code, but not in Haskell that I am aware of.

My approach owes a lot to Richard Bird's sudoku solver in [Pearls of Functional Algortithim Design](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/pearls-functional-algorithm-design?format=HB&isbn=9780521513388) and you can read about it in my blog post [Solving binary puzzles with Haskell](https://charlieharvey.org.uk/page/solving_binary_pussles_with_haskell).
